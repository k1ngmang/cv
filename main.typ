== About

Hi! My name is Artyom. I'm a backend developer from Belarus. I'm also interested in compiler development.

Languages: Go, Java, Kotlin, Scala


== 2018 - 2020

I started programming on Scratch at the age of 10. I participated in various events and won prizes.

== 2020 - 2022

Перешел на java, все еще была интересна разработка игр, поэтому
занимался gamedev'ов на java + processing. Выполнял заказы на простые игры.

== 2022 - 2025

I became interested in web application and compiler development. I wrote compilers for Wiring, JVM, and other platforms, as well as interpreters. I worked on various programming languages. My most popular projects were: #link("https://github.com/ixionlang/ixion", "Ixion"), #link("https://github.com/k1ngmang/lazurite", "Lazurite").

I began to shift from game development to engine development.
I completed projects developing mobile apps and other services.

== 2025

I remain interested in programming language development and am actively studying languages ​​that interest me (for example, Gleam, D, Neva).
